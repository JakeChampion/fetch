"New York State requires this income tax return to be filed electronically.
New York State law requires income tax returns prepared using software to be e-filed. Because this New York State tax return was prepared using software, you MUST file it electronically.
Besides being the law, e-filing has many advantages:
•  Taxpayers using e-file get their New York State refunds twice as fast as paper filers.
•  E-filing is fast, easy, and secure.
•  There are no additional costs for e-filing. Once you’ve paid for your New York State tax preparation soft- ware, you’re entitled to FREE e-filing of your New York State return.
Most New Yorkers enjoy the benefits of e-filing."
